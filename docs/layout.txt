# choose directory to display pictures from - dialogue box
display an array of all pictures within directory
three buttons on each picture - discard, save, mark and save
discard - move to {discard directory}
save - move to {save directory}, append original path to {save directory}/{filename}.original_path
mark and save - move to {mark directory} and save original path to {mark directory}/{filename}.original_path

later:
button to run labellimg on mark directory
autorun instance of labellimg when choosing "mark and save"

classify {discard directory}, {save directory} and {mark directory} for suggestion on placement screen

compare pictures between directories - the same picture in different directories?
    compare filenames
    compare content
        actual picture data
        metadata

display a stacked, randomly selected and limited if more than what fits into one screen, view of the pictures in a folder
    combine half of screen with the picture worked on atm
        if working on picture was within the stacked display then replace with another randomly selected
        if area of stacked images becomes larger than the number of pictures, do something to beutify and keep Ux
    perhaps every picture placeholder is a black area, later filled by a picture
