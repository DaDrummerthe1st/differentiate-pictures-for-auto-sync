Phone app:
    Swipe for discard (left) / save (right) / mark (down) / undo (up)

AI:
Classify {discard directory}, {save directory} and {mark directory} for suggestion by dividing into different directories.
    On mobile devices not yet synced with server: rename discarded files so common gallery apps dont find it
        Create local temp database with choices, also syncing this with server

compare pictures between directories - the same picture in different directories?
    compare filenames
    compare content
        actual picture data
            date, changed date, size
        metadata

display a stacked, randomly selected and limited if more than what fits into one screen, view of the pictures in a folder
    combine half of screen with the picture worked on atm
        if working on picture was within the stacked display then replace with another randomly selected
        if area of stacked images becomes larger than the number of pictures, do something to beutify and keep Ux
    perhaps every picture placeholder is a black area, later filled by a picture
